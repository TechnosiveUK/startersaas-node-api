# Stripe setup

Configure your stripe webhooks by setting as "Endpoint URL" :

```
https://<my_startersaas_api_domain>/api/v1/stripe/webhook
```

and events below:

```
invoice.payment_succeeded
invoice.payment_failed
customer.subscription.created
customer.subscription.updated
```

For local development, use the stripe-cli to build a local tunnel:

```bash
stripe listen --load-from-webhooks-api --forward-to localhost:3000
```

Configure Stripe to retry failed payments for X days (https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/automatic Smart Retries section), and then cancel the subscription. 

Remember this value, it will be used in the `.env` file in `PAYMENT_FAILED_RETRY_DAYS` variable.

# Configuring stripe.js.json

In this file you have to add the stripe API public key, in the `publicKey` field

Then for every product you want to sell, copy it's price_id (usually starts with price_xxx) and paste it in the "id" key.

```
{
  "id": "price_XYZ",
  "title": "Starter",
  "price": 4.90,
  "currency": "EUR",
  "features": [
    "1 project",
    "0 tags",
    "star entries",
    "1 user",
    "3 days data retention",
    "no push notifications"
  ],
  "monthly": true,
  "planType": "starter"
}
```

Then sets its title, its price (in cents, the same you have configured in Stripe) and the list of features you want to show in the frontend pricing table. 

Set `"monthly":true` if your plan is billed on monthly basis, otherwise we consider it billed yearly.

Set `"planType"` with your plan code to a more user friendly knowledge of the current plan.

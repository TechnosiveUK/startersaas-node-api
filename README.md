# Starter SaaS Node API

This project contains everything you need to setup a fully featured SaaS API in 5 minutes.
# Installation
Make sure you have MongoDB (4+) installed and running.

Then make sure you have Node installed. Version `14` or higher is required.

Install all dependencies by running 

```bash
npm install
```
 
Copy `.env.example` into `.env` and `stripe.conf.js.example` into `stripe.conf.js`.

Store email templates on database by typing:

```bash
npm run store:emails
```

Finally, run the APIs by typing:

```bash
npm run dev
```


# Stripe setup

Configure your stripe webhooks by setting as "Endpoint URL" :

```
https://<my_startersaas_api_domain>/api/v1/stripe/webhook
```

and events below:

```
invoice.payment_succeeded
invoice.payment_failed
customer.subscription.created
customer.subscription.updated
```

Configure Stripe to retry failed payments for X days (https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/automatic Smart Retries section), and then cancel the subscription. 

Remember this value, it will be used in the `.env` file in `PAYMENT_FAILED_RETRY_DAYS` variable.

# Configuring .env

Below the meaning of every environment variable you can setup.


`PORT=":3000"` the API server port number

`LOG_LEVEL="debug"` set info on the production environment

`DEBUG=true` set false in production

`JWT_SECRET="aaabbbccc"` set this value secrect, very long and random

`JWT_EXPIRE="1d"` # how long the JWT token last

`DEFAULT_LOCALE="en"` the default locale for registered users

`AVAILABLE_LOCALES=en it` an array of available locales for translations

`LOCAL_MONGO_CONNECTION='mongodb://localhost/startersaas-db'`Â the MongoDB connection string

`REDIS_HOST=""` Redis server host
`REDIS_PORT=""`  Redis server port

`DEFAULT_EMAIL_FROM="noreply@startersaas.com"` send every notification email from this address

`MAILER_HOST='localhost'` the SMTP server host
`MAILER_PORT=1025` the SMTP server port
`MAILER_USERNAME='foo'` the SMTP server username
`MAILER_PASSWORD='bar'` the SMTP server password

`STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="sk_test_xyz"` the Stripe secret key

`NOTIFIED_ADMIN_EMAIL="info@startersaas.com"` we notify admins when some events occur, like a new subscription, a failed payment and so on

`FATTURA24_KEY="XYZ"` the Fattura 24 secret key (Italian market only)

`FRONTEND_LOGIN_URL="http://localhost:5000/auth/login"` raplace http://localhost:5000 with the real production host of the React frontend

`TRIAL_DAYS=15` how many days a new user can work without subscribing

`PAYMENT_FAILED_RETRY_DAYS=7` how many days a user can work after the first failed payment (and before Stripe cancel the subscription)


# Configuring stripe.js.json

In this file you have to add the stripe API public key, in the `publicKey` field

Then for every product you want to sell, copy it's price_id (usually starts with price_xxx) and paste it in the "id" key.

```
{
  id: 'price_xxx',
  title: 'Starter - Piano Mensile',
  price: 199,
  currency: 'EUR',
  features: ['Piano editoriale', '1 post Facebook', '1 post Instagram', '1 Facebook story', '1 Instagram story', '1 articolo per il blog', '-', '-', '-'],
  monthly: true
}
```

Then sets its title, its price (in cents, the same you have configured in Stripe) and the list of features you want to show in the frontend pricing table. 

Finally set `"monthly":true` if your plan is billed on monthly basis, otherwise we consider it billed yearly.
